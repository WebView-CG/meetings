### Agenda

* **TAG Draft about user agents (Ben)**
    * [https://w3ctag.github.io/user-agents/](https://w3ctag.github.io/user-agents/)
    * [https://github.com/orgs/WebView-CG/discussions/7](https://github.com/orgs/WebView-CG/discussions/7)
    * Ben: TAG is trying to define what a user agent actually *is*, to complete the definition usage in other specs. 
        * WebViews should be mentioned in the definition for clarity
        * Time pressure - in-person meeting next week. We need to open an issue latest 2025-03-03
    * Key points to raise:
        * WebViews are not an enforcement mechanism. Browsers can protect users, while WebViews on their own cannot protect the user
        * WebViews do not typically have UX surfaces. Specs refer to UX such as “meaningful user consent”, which is not something that WebViews support on their own.
    * Dominique: The key part of the definition is that claiming to be a user agent comes with responsibilities towards the user. These assumptions do not hold for WebViews
        * There is already an open issue (above). That might be where we want to chime in. 
        * WebViews currently have a lot of inconsistencies in how they handle these privacy and security concerns. We should see if we can move towards more uniform handling for WebViews.
    * Niklas: To clarify, the purpose of this is just to make the TAG aware that WebViews need to be considered?
        * Ben: yes!
    * Bryan: Isn’t WebViews in part responsible for protecting users, for example through enforcing same-origin policy.
        * Ben: WebViews can try and do the best, but cannot make promises. Android developers can recompile WebView and use in their app with any changes they want. WebViews can at best have good defaults.
        * Specifically, this applies to WebView providers
        * Niklas: The capabilities of WebViews makes them more open than regular browsers. Cordova provides a JS Bridge that allows data passing in and out of the WebView.
    * Dom: Is there a configuration mode for WebViews that is as safe as can be?
        * Ben: That is most likely the default settings, for each WebView provider. 
        * Niklas: Chrome Custom Tabs / SafariViewControllers are “safe” WebViews
            * Mihai: Those are not true WebViews, but are in fact browsers
    * Peter: WebViews allow app developers to build a user agent, but are a component in their own.
        * Ashley: We should probably make this point to the TAG, that apps using WebView may become Web User Agents
        * Dominique: Not all apps may want to accept the responsibility of being a Web User Agent. Not all apps want to take responsibility for users conducting their banking in their app for example.
        * There are responsibilities you may be willing to take while rendering your own content, that you are not willing to carry if you are rendering 3P content (as an app developer)
    * *See Action Items*
* **WebView Testing**
    * Present PoC apps [CanIAndroidWebView](https://github.com/WebView-CG/CanIAndroidWebView) and [CanIWKWebView](https://github.com/WebView-CG/CanIWKWebView) (Niklas)
        * Surprisingly, Cordova doesn’t actually change that many settings in their WebViews
        * We could publish these apps under the “caniwebview.com” brand
        * The apps allow the user to load a URL and configure the settings for the WebView in use, with a few presets.
        * The apps can be used to highlight compatibility differences between Android and iOS.
        * Android version is already published 🎉
        * Open question: Who maintains these apps long-term?
    * Peter: It is probably better to have a unified app across Android and iOS. 
        * Chromium has [https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/android_webview/docs/webview-shell.md](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/android_webview/docs/webview-shell.md) which does the same thing, but contains a lot of extra functionality specific to being an Android WebView developer.
    * Ben: Can we establish a WebView-CG account on app stores?
        * Dom: Not entirely sure what level of support could be granted, or whether it could be W3C branded.
        * Ben: Funding also needs to be sorted out
    * Ben: WebView teams may contribute to open-source apps as community contributions
    * Ashley: WebView2 app is coming at some point. 
        * Windows will still let you run unsigned apps, so they are a lot easier to distribute.
    * Niklas: Android distribution is not too hard. Apple distribution requires payment for the developer account.
    * Niklas: What Should we distribute under the caniwebview.com name? That is our name.
    * Dom: Gofundme or other open-source funding structures have some precedent, in particular opencollective.com
    * Ben: We should avoid individual personal owners. 
    * Niklas: We should also not have personally owned domains as part of this long-term.
    * Mihai: Could there be options of corporate sponsorships as well?
        * Dom: The funding and W3C support is tricky since this is a community group. 
    * Peter: If we make these apps usable for browser automation vendors, they may be willing to help sponsor
    * Ben: Those vendors should at least be consulted before we start planning out any automation. 
    * Dom: There are already conversations with BrowserStack.
        * Does WebView support WebDriver
        * [https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/webviews](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/webviews)
    * 
* **Potentially Misleading BCD Data (e.g., Safe Area & Meta Tags) – Niklas & Bryan**
    * ** **Cordova discovered discrepancies in the behavior of "safe-area-inset-top" and "viewport-fit" between Android's WebView and iOS's WKWebView.
        * Related Chromium Issue: [https://issues.chromium.org/issues/396827865](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/396827865)
        * This raises questions about the accuracy and level of detail of Browser Compatibility Data (BCD) and the information provided by CanIWebView.com.
            * How to capture description and record discrepancies
            * How to link WebAPI documentation to behavioral docs
    * Meta Tag Support on CanIWebView:
        * Is the HTML "&lt;meta>" tag considered "supported" only based on the element but not the actual meta properties?
        * Could "&lt;meta>" properties be included as part of the BCD testing and how to confirm accuracy if its behavior is visual?
        * Examples of meta tags properties with discrepancies:
            * "viewport-fit" (part of "meta name="viewport"")
            * "theme-color" ("meta name="theme-color"")
    * Niklas: Discussion point: How do we address the lack of information here?
    * Dom: There should be more data on viewport in the BCD data. These issues seem like something that should be documented in BCD upstream. 
    * Ben: It’s very possible that we are just not mapping all the keys yet. There is also a difference between using hyphens and not when searching.
    * [https://github.com/WebView-CG/Compatibility-Data-Project/blob/main/_plugins/generated_features.rb#L108](https://github.com/WebView-CG/Compatibility-Data-Project/blob/main/_plugins/generated_features.rb#L108)
    * Bryan: The meta tag is an interesting corner case, since it covers so many things. Maybe we don’t want to render a full green box for the meta tag. Can we change how we score complex features like this, where the behaviors are important.
    * Ben: We are exposing 3 types of data: Behavioural are our own notes. BCD is yes/no feature availability. And finally, web developers tend to think of features in groups of related individual features. 
    * Dominique: BCD doesn’t have compatibility data about meta viewport. Possibly because it was initially desktop-focused. This should be fixed
        * There may also be gaps around pixel density.
