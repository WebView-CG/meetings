### Agenda & Notes

* Anything new on Baseline?
  * WebViews & Baseline
    * Tony: Google has a dedicated team to interop-related projects (Interop, Baseline); I'm involved in outreach, incl explaining it and getting it adopted by tools (IDE, linters, CLIs, etc), also analytics and RUM providers (e.g. RUM vision, cloudflare, content square) to help developers assess the right target for their baselines. Spent a lot of time this year in getting included in BrowserList, as it serves as a basis for many other tools, needing to get data on browsers beyond the core browser set (e.g. via mapping other browsers to their upstream Chromium/Gecko versions) ⇒ browser baseline mapping package, also helpful to target "baseline widely available" on certain dates (e.g. certain release dates, as Angular is committing to do moving forward, Vite as input to esbuild)
    * Tony: in terms of WebView - the delta between webviews and their upstream browser is not reflected in baseline mapping, among other things because of the complexity of the space. We're getting close to be in a situation where we can say "widely available - but not in webviews" - for developers that are targeting webviews specifically. The dataset supporting caniwebview is super useful - question is how to surface it in other pipeline
    * Dom: BCD is collecting exceptions for WebViews; in general, surfacing webviews exceptions may be better done outside of the "baseline" brand, since the key part is upgrading tools to be able to add these views
    * Tony: we're looking more generally at surfacing exceptions in browser list, possibly by web-features, and possibly later through other considerations (e.g. webviews)
    * Niklas: [explains how caniwebview surface the data]
    * Tony: a subfeature of HTML `<select>` is not supported in WebViews, which hits at some tough issues of granularity in web-features (e.g. see [https://www.roboleary.net/blog/baseline-text-wrap-pretty/](https://www.roboleary.net/blog/baseline-text-wrap-pretty/) ); web-features 3.0 adds splits/merges with redirects that help dealing with some of this evolving granuarity
    * Peter: one challenge with "WebView" is that the default Android WebView had no JS, no storage without configuration; a lot of WebViews is config-dependent. Having a default browser-friendly equivalent configuration would be good
    * Tony: surfacing that configuration dependency in canIwebView data would be good; web-features that are widely/newly available doesn't mean that the Bluetooth API will work on a non-Bluetooth device - it just means the error handling will be per-spec
    * Dom: CanIWebView data is bcd so we might need to change BCD
    * Tony: or this could be handled in an intermediary layer maintained for CanIWebView
    * Florian: more data in BCD is always possible; "Baseline widely available" gives developer an assumption that "it just works". If it doesn't work in WebViews, it breaks a bit that promise. @@@
    * Tony: there will be pushback in the WebDX CG: how confident are in the data on webviews in BCD? Unlikely to change the default baseline definition for webview, but pushing it via a side channel sounds interesting, the same way how some baseline features get get asterisked on MDN when a sub-feature doesn't work
    * Florian: +1 on improving data quality; how many "baseline" regression adding webviews would generate?
    * Dom: that links back to the project of providing Android/iOS webviews to easily test web content with different configurations
    * Niklas: the apps are now available on the stores [caniwebview.com/apps](http://caniwebview.com/apps), and make it easy to run BCD collector with different configurations; still looking at adding WebDriver integration which would help further. Please come back with news from WebDX (we'll meet with them at TPAC)**	**
* CanIWebView
  * Apps [https://caniwebview.com/apps/](https://caniwebview.com/apps/)
  * iPadOS on caniwebview: [https://github.com/WebView-CG/Compatibility-Data-Project/pull/55](https://github.com/WebView-CG/Compatibility-Data-Project/pull/55)
  * Servo in BCD
* Intersections with other work [Dom]
  * MCP-UI
    * UI for AI agents
    * Need for AI to get information in and out currently with HTML/iframe
    * Communication between Agent and WebView
    * WebView is similar to an iframe and could be used in this use case
    * Discord Community
  * Game Load & Control CG
    * Newly launched Community Group
    * Integrate Apps in Webapps, interaction between apps and web content
    * Goal of creating a new API for postMessage like Interface
    * Explore potential collaboration
  * Servo WebView API
    * Renewed interest in Servo with key use case on embedding
    * Consider talking with Igalia
    * Niklas: I'm on this

### Action items

* Niklas: Drill down web features?
* Niklas: Discuss configurable Features for WebViews in  BCD get new Status?
* Tony+Florian: Break down what’s the delta on widely available if we include WebView
