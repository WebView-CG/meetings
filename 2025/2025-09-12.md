### Agenda & Notes

* WebViews in the user agent definition
  * [https://github.com/w3ctag/user-agents/pull/21](https://github.com/w3ctag/user-agents/pull/21)
  * Expecting to merge this next week
  * More feedback when it is in the main draft
  * Iterating on it still
  * Please give feedback, just comment on the PR
  * Generally happy with the text, especially the first/third party concept
* [CanIWebview.com](http://caniwebview.com) and WebView Tooling Funding Project
  * [https://nlnet.nl/project/W3CWebview-tooling/](https://nlnet.nl/project/W3CWebview-tooling/)
  * WebViews
  * Compare WebViews
  * Components to behaviors across WebViews
  * Test default configurations, and other common configurations
  * Meta is using android instrumentation tests.  Injected JS to control web pages. Okhttp MockWebServer.
  * Testing behavior of APIs and testing behavior inside the web engine is tricky
  * Collect and document data on multiple WebViews
  * The difference between engines and webviews is important for MDN etc.
  * WebViews unexpectedly failing is a big issue (Aram)
  * Baseline: We need data and marketshare data to make a point
  * Ben: We need to voice things that going wrong
  * Aram: WebView is hard to debug and complex to understand issues
  * Sometimes you can see issues by just opening the website and sometimes different apps act unexpectedly
  * We should assemble documentation on problems we found.
  * Many developers don’t know why things are happening the way they are
  * Niklas: Have a place to document issues, causes and workarounds
* Marketshare
  * How do we find out the market share of WebViews for baseline etc?
  * Aram: Hard to tell from our traffic and app
  * Ben: Facebook has ;WV in the user agent string, but there are some quirks
  * Looking at traffic does not show the full picture of webview market share
  * We should find out how webview would change which features are in baseline
  * For example features with UI usually don’t work in WebView
  * To be considered part of the Baseline definition, part of the important feedback we got last year was how much developers take the said target (in our case, webviews) in their process decision to use or not use a Web feature; also, not working in a default WebView doesn't necessarily imply not working in popular client based on WebViews (e.g. facebook IAB)
  * Meta ships a fork of chromium WebView:
    * [https://engineering.fb.com/2022/09/30/android/launching-a-new-chromium-based-webview-for-android/](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/09/30/android/launching-a-new-chromium-based-webview-for-android/)
  * CanIWebView is outdated
* Continue WebView definition or WebView Best Practices Guide
  * [https://github.com/WebView-CG/webview-handbook/blob/main/list.md](https://github.com/WebView-CG/webview-handbook/blob/main/list.md)
  * [https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/111](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/111)
  * [https://research.google/pubs/what-is-in-a-web-view-an-analysis-of-progressive-web-app-features-when-the-means-of-web-access-is-not-a-web-browser/](https://research.google/pubs/what-is-in-a-web-view-an-analysis-of-progressive-web-app-features-when-the-means-of-web-access-is-not-a-web-browser/)
  * Ben: Common security flaw: apps have url bar, attacker can abort the load -> URL spoofing
  * Only update the url bar from webview not in advance, dont trust the url
  * Niklas: Looking for places and ways to present this
  * Florian: MDN might reach more people

### Action items

* Niklas: Fix BCD update for caniwebview
* Niklas: Prepare tasks for testing journey and present this
* Niklas: Prepare best practices guide
