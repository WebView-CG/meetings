### Notes
* Welcome new folks (round of intros)
    * Ashley, founder of Scirra, games company based on WebView
    * Josh Kadis, principal developer for WSJ intersections with the Web, with a focus on WebView primarily on iOS to display articles that have custom graphics and more complicated visuals
* 2024 recap
    * [https://caniwebview.com/news/2024-12-06-WebView-Community-Group-Recap/](https://caniwebview.com/news/2024-12-06-WebView-Community-Group-Recap/)
        * Survey in China
        * CanIWebView project and compat data
            * Stats on CanIWebView: 
                * still small but growing over time, with now referrals from caniuse
                * Interest in WKWebView, Android Web view; different interest across features month over month
* Revisit charter and roadmap for 2025
    * Reminder that our overriding goal is to understand and reduce issues arising from using WebViews
        * 2024: 
            * lots of work on identifying behaviors
            * Surveys helps with understanding
            * Not much on reducing so far
        * 2025:
            * More surveys would be good
            * Task force to get going on standardizing behaviors?
            * Path to help test a WebApp in web views
    * Dom: Would be really eager to get started on the standardization
        * I suspect the cost of changing things is high enough that evidence for real developer issues needs to be high
        * Maybe we could work with Android WebView developers since they are already here
        * On the survey - the web games cg ran a survey last year and there may be interesting intersections here
    * Ben: +1 to accelerate work on standardization; maybe we need to take a step back on how to approach these issues we want to bring solutions to; explainers may work well for browser vendors, but maybe for our group that has strong developer engagement, our focus may be better in discussing developer pain points; understanding them well and how broadly they impact folks
    * Niklas: how do we want to show these problems we want to fix? Maybe explainers aren't the right approach; maybe "show in code", proof of concepts that demonstrate very specifically the issue
    * Ben: +1 - once it's a well-structured, we can more easily bring this internally for greater attention; another piece of this is figuring out which can be fixed without backwards compat (although just piling up APIs isn't a solution either)
    * Ashley: being able to have a well-defined minimal wrapper that can be used for these bug/issue reports; I've had this issue when reporting bugs based on my usage through Cordova
    * Ben: there is an app in Chromium we use to test our WebView; if we were to release an apk, it would be interesting to see who would use it, maybe even help maintain it
    * Niklas: I really like that idea; if we could release this under the CanIWebView umbrella / WebView CG as an open source project, this would be a great starting point for this
    * Aram: that would be very useful; making it usable on desktop as well would be good; being able to push a browser into webview mode (similar to how they have a mobile view) would be very useful
    * Peter: publishing the system webview as an apk would be great; this helps test if you have webcontent that doesn't behave as expected; a lot of time, the issue comes from how the webview has been configured - e.g. Cordova is likely come to with a different config that what a browser would typically have
    * Ashley: I would be happy to do one for MS Edge WebView2
    * Ben: testing webviews in general sounds like a good problem to kickoff for this year. If we start getting better at structuring problems, we can then inject that in the survey process and build momentum from developers responses
    * Dom: let's identify the native developers community we want to reach out to
    * Niklas: happy to give a try at setting up a simple iOS wrapper as well
    * Ben: it's probably interesting to get a sense of what the most representative config of WebView might be
    * Dom: I wonder if what we could converge on is a way to automate running in WebViews - then if we discover there are more profiles, we start to compare behaviours in different ways
    * Ben: starting this for a single WebView, with or without cloud automation initially
    * Aram: Happy to test it as a user (but unlikely to be the right person to develop)
    * Niklas: happy to contribute the basic config used in Cordova
* Open floor
    * Martin: Adding a new WebView (ArcWeb) into BCD. Last month, there was an interesting members organizing by W3C China with Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance, etc; one topic was WebView with perspectives from Huawei and Tencent and the needs to improve the standards way to create miniapps (part of the MiniApps WG), but also a concern around getting a more performance webview or browser - one of the outcomes of the discussion was the creation of a new CG to deal with a profile for more performant webapps; Dom shared some of the risks associated with profiles/subsetting (fragmentation)
    * Proposal under discussion:

            *The [High-Performance Baseline Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/high-perf-baseline/) aims to diversify the ecosystem of Web user agents by enabling a baseline or subset of standards to increase efficiency and optimize the user experience on Web and WebView-based apps while maintaining compatibility with existing standards. Standards subsets and modularity allow the implementation of lighter and more efficient engines for specific-scenario purposes when a full-fledged (embedded) browser is not required (e.g., MiniApps, WoT edge apps, and apps for wearables or constrained infotainment systems) and may serve as common ground for cross-platform development frameworks. Furthermore, establishing standard-based profiles would enable modularization in user agents, facilitating the development roadmap of new Web user agents (e.g., Servo and Ladybird) from scratch.  *


            *This CG is a forum for vendors of embedded browsers, hybrid cross-platform app frameworks, JS engines and others interested in exploring the modularity of the Web standards. We aim to collect use cases where standard profiles help enrich the Web ecosystem by opening new possibilities in unexplored scenarios and supporting innovation on the Web while protecting the principles of universality and interoperability.  *


            *This group needs close alignment with other incubation groups working on similar topics (i.e., WebViews CG, WinterTC) and bi-directional conversations with core standardization groups for advice and pushing for new standardization requirements while avoiding fragmentation. We will start with the use case collection and continue with more specific goals, like defining and testing specific scenario profiles to validate the concept. [More news after the Lunar New Year]*

* Ben: we've added to canIWeb the ability to see web features (i.e. if something is "baseline" for WebViews)
