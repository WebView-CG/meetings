## Notes

* TPAC 2024 recap and action items
  * Ben:Improve visibility of WebViews
  * Ben: Make them first class citizen
  * Ben: Catched up internally on Arams idea of improving testing, no progress to report until next year
* New stuff for caniwebview
  * Ben:
    * Progress on the data front
    * WKWebView landed in BCD right before TPAC
    * Compare the big two mobile webviews
    * Triangle of data sources and granularity -> BCD, Web features
    * Web Features now on caniwebview
    * Baseline status on caniwebview -> widely available in browsers but not in webviews
    * We can now compare browser and webviews on the web features category
    * Useful for browser vendors
  * Some hacking required to get the baseline Nodejs tooling work with a Jekyll plugin
  * Niklas:
    * Use the compare table to find faulty data
    * Makes it easier to flag inconsistency
    * We could  need help styling the site a bit
* Review[impact](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16oqOKJ3iuuyF-yt4TgUQAH49daRFBiK0zg636jdV1Ow/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.reyjidskwuws) of WebViews on baseline
  * Can be viewed on the clients page of caniwebview: [https://caniwebview.com/clients/](https://caniwebview.com/clients/) with the web features category
* Task Force
  * Ben
    * Make this group to improve things ultimately
    * Data compat is just a starting point
    * Empathize improving the ecosystem
    * Pick up a workstream on capturing the behaviorally side
    * Once we have sense back it up with survey we can go into explainers backed by data
    * E-mailed list of TPAC attendees who volunteered
* Anything else
  * Letâ€™s ask the group for meeting timing
