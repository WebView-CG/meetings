## Notes

* Discuss WebView survey ([discussion](https://github.com/orgs/WebView-CG/discussions/3), [repository](https://github.com/WebView-CG/webview-survey))
    * Niklas: we discussed this last time, and we received contributions in the github discussion with good suggestions; I've created a github repo to collect these questions in markdown; I suggest we target multiple choice questions to help with processing the answers. Please keep contributions coming; we'll need to find tools / places to publish the survey
    * Ben: It would be good to discuss our timeline - which will also help getting contributions; in terms of distribution, Florian had alluded to a possibility last time?
    * Florian: MDN can run short surveys; it may qualify for there
    * Niklas: Who should we be working with on this?
    * Florian: Francois or I
    * Francois: this would be done through the WebDX CG; the survey looks a bit longish for an MDN short survey though
    * Niklas: Lets shrink down the questions and take it there; should we wait a few weeks to gather feedback before bringing this to the WebDX CG?
    * Ben: let's aim to have questions ready in a couple of weeks and send it to them for feedback
    * Dom: Like the idea of understanding WebView developer challenges, I think a survey will get part of the way there. Not sure if MDN will be the right forum because it is web developer focused - might be a risk of missing the native developers. We should discuss the developers we should target. Some of the questions are about priorities - surveys are good but we will benefit from in-depth conversations so we should consider the survey as an outreach mechanism to discuss further with the community. And lastly, categorizing what we expect to get out of the questions.
    * Niklas: good points; indeed worthwhile getting a clearer view of what interpretation we can expect from the various questions
    * Ben: categorization may also help with cutting down the list; let's create github issues for each audience we're going to target, what we expect from that audience, and possibly slim down the questions based on the said target
    * François: e.g. the question on documentation, if asked on MDN, may not provide very informative answer (given the MDN bias)
    * Niklas: likewise if we ask webview platform on Android documentation
* Decide if we are committing to new charter proposal ([issue](https://github.com/WebView-CG/charter/issues/12), [PR](https://github.com/WebView-CG/charter/pull/13), [repository](https://github.com/WebView-CG/Compatibility-Data-Project))
    * Ben: would like to finalize the charter, so that we can start the compatibility project; Andy raised the question about the surface of what the compatibility data should cover (Web-only or also native); we could keep it ambiguous
    * Dom: I think what we want to cover is anything where we expect interoperability - at this point, it's mostly Web-exposed APIs, but as we develop new interoperable surfaces that are not strictly within a browser surface, I think we ought to be able to work on those without rechartering
    * Ben: that aligns with my thinking
    * Francois: the scope of the charter helps with organizations determine whether they can join the CG; I would avoid portraying things around "native" APIs (where convergence would likely be hard to push for), but instead talk about specific APIs where **webviews** may need to converge
    * Tom: Given that WebView-based browsers (e.g., Facebook “browser”) are very much a thing, I think the definition is inclusive. 
    * Ben: [proposes a rewrite] please provide feedback on this before the top of the hour
    * Ben: I have created a repo where we can already start some discussions on the compat data project - I have created 4 issues there where some discussion is already starting
    * Dom: Similar exercise of selecting a core browser set was done in the WebDX CG for the web-features / Baseline effort. It feels very similar for WebViews.
    * Ben: important comparison, esp as we start discussing webview-specific behavior (e.g. what gets exposed to developers with or without user explicit consent)
    * Francois: re collecting data on "native" API compat data - i.e. non-web API - the data would be different from what is currently collected in BCD
    * Ben: it may have to answer questions that BCD already has answered to (e.g. in terms of structuring it, collecting data); I'll think about what kind of workstream can support that and the question around security & privacy
    * Niklas: data on security & privacy is really critical for webview developers, esp as their timelines are often different from regular browser changes
    * Ben: as an example, I was recently trying to understand the cookie policy story for WKWebView - it is indeed challenging
    * Dom: Thinking of privacy from the reverse perspective, also collect data on the privacy needs and work backwards from that - it may help us understand where these policies may have a path to converge. But it is also clear this would be directly useful for developers (although the cost of collecting and maintaining that data will be higher than say for regular API support data)
    * Ben: I'll take a stab at the behavioral issues
    * Florian: I'm happy to help with BCD improvements for Android WebView
    * Ben: I'll also try to get involvement from WKWebView developers
* Check on earlier session’s time slot
    * Niklas: we will move the next instance of this call earlier to make it more workable for Asia
* Tom: Meta request: can we add one file to [https://github.com/WebView-CG/Compatibility-Data-Project](https://github.com/WebView-CG/Compatibility-Data-Project), so it can be watched? Thank you!
