* Intros & Admin
    * 2 meetings this week: today and Thu with different themes between them
        * Tue: compat data
            * A Discuss Surveys (40min)
            * B WebView in Baseline (40min)
        * Thu: State of WebViews report
* Group survey results
    * Review results from short survey
        * Thank you Martin Alvarez for helping with this
        * Martin presenting the survey results
            * Survey slides with the link to the raw results: https://webview-cg.github.io/tpac/TPAC-2024/WebViewCG/CN_Webviews_Survey/
            * Survey was run with the Chinese Community for a full month to get some results and insights on the community in CHina
            * Great support from W3C China in terms of reaching out to community, they used various channels to reach developers
            * 34 responses received
            * Aim was to get some feedback to discuss at TPAC now and iterate on the survey for a global audience
        * #1 Asked for the types of WebViews used
            * We need to clarify the audience for the survey and what webviews are for the survey
        * #2 What situations of WebVies are used?
        * #3 Features of WebView being used?
            * JS injection the top one
        * #4 *TBC*
        * #5 Top pain points
        * #6 *TBC*
        * #7 Platforms developed on
        * #9 Implementation used:
            * Android top one
            * Tencent WebView important due to the use for mini apps
        * #10 *TBC*
        * #11-#12 Documentation – how to file bugs and docs
            * This might be confusing as filing bugs and documentation are asked together
        * Open ended questions around challenges with missing documentation
            * Lack of standard documentation the main concerns
            * Limitations and restrictions
        * #14 How new features are being tracked
        * #15 Programming language used
            * Wide variety with most JS
        * #17 how consistent behaviour is achieved across different platforms
        * #18 Manual testing was the top one on how this consistent behaviour is validated
        * #19 Features missing from PWA that if added would motivate sticking with PWA
            * More PWA support and JS injection the top ones
        * #20 How do they decide to use WebView instead of forcing navigation to browser
            * Keeping experience within the app
        * #21 How do you work around shortcomings with WebView
            * Top mention: avoid webviews
            * Asking the community
        * #22 Thoughts on privacy and security for WebView
            * Most have no opinion
        * #23 Features missing in WebView
            * Pre-rendering top one
            * Francois: Question included pre-render and webview pool and may have guided answers
    * Q&A on survey and results
        * Ben: would it benefit to do 2 surveys to do more targeting (web and app developers) as it seems for this one most were app developers
        * Martin: it seems some are not aware of what WebView is as a technology
            * Might be worth including some examples of how WebViews are being used
        * Ben: maybe we do multiple smaller surveys here
        * Xiaocheng: usage of WebView vs browsers
            * Surprised that we have half usage of browsers as that is different than my daily experience in China
            * Basically one doesn’t open a browser 
            * The survey allowed only one choice
            * QR code: open Wechat to scan it, and if there is navigation involved it is in Wechat or another app and only if that is not installed you open the browser
            * Regarding which WebView implementation targeting 
                * Is Tencent Skyline included? They implemented a light version as an alternative to WV as they considered it is too heavy and has too many features for mini apps
                * Do we consider that a WebView?
                * Either we consider as a variant or a competitor
                * Martin: most mini apps are using a different architecture (vs standard DOM) – it’s a very specific case to China
                * Ben: takeaway – seems like a reason is that they want a non-standard behaviour, would be interesting to understand how we can bring more conformity to the space
        * Niklas: going back to the question of having 2 audiences
            * Maybe we have an intro question on the type of developer they are (web and app) with examples to redirect to the appropriate survey
        * Andrew (Meta): hard to break apart the use cases (1P vs browser)
            * Would be keen to learn more about perception of freshness
            * Ben: for the Chinese market the updatability is typically a problem
                * Is the perspective more from security?
                * Andrew: More from web compatibility standpoint, e.g. service workers support
        * François: where is the survey hosted? As it seems there are more presented in this session [in the repo](https://github.com/WebView-CG/webview-survey).
            * Niklas: will update it to have all the additional questions that were included for the Chinese version
        * Ben: [https://github.com/WebView-CG/webview-survey](https://github.com/WebView-CG/webview-survey)
            * Feel free to open PRs if you want to tweak any particular questions
        * Cathy: question about the type of WebView being used in China given Play is locked down
            * Connecting to the freshness perspective – if the latest system WebView is available then this might not be much of a problem
            * If they can’t get the WebView then how are they getting it distributed
            * Ben: there are likely a lot of region specific motivations – might want to resent the updated survey to the Chinese market
        * Ben: vibe check – might be worth how we split this based on different groups?
            * Martin: adding more information based on the context will be important to reply
        * Niklas: going to the point of different surveys
            * We can look at what questions are most useful and boil it down to a smaller list
            * Maybe get insights on what is the right amount of questions so that people 
        * Mihai
            * Like targeting particular markets sounds preferable - sounds better by different surveys
            * We trim the larger set of questions down to each group
            * Do we have data on how many people drop off?
                * Martin: No
        * Ben: try to figure out with the next CG meeting after TPAC on how we can split the survey and get this out at the beginning of next year (nods around the room)
        * François: length depends on how it is run
            * MDN needs short number of questions
            * State of __ surveys which have plenty of questions and people are enthusiastic about
                * UI is pretty great for this too
                * Turn that into State of WebViews might be a possibility here
            * Ben: who would be the best point of contact to learn more here?
                * Kadir Topal (Google), Sacha Greif (State of XXX surveys)
    * Review plan for long survey
        * Feedback from this survey:
            * Adding multiple choice to make it quicker to fill in
            * Less questions to not overwhelm
        * Ben: would be good to talk about rough timeline to send this out
            * Sending this during the New Year might be hard to get responses
* WebViews in baseline
    * What is it?
        * [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/baseline-unified-view-stable-web-features/](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/baseline-unified-view-stable-web-features/)
        * Effort to provide a holistic view of web browsers: caniuse, caniwebview
    * Review WebViews in BCD & caniuse + caniwebview
        * Ben: Compatibility Data Project repo: [https://github.com/WebView-CG/Compatibility-Data-Project](https://github.com/WebView-CG/Compatibility-Data-Project) 
            * Web platform compatibility data
            * Behavioral compatibility
        * [“_features” folder](https://github.com/WebView-CG/Compatibility-Data-Project/tree/main/_features) on throwing ideas
        * Niklas: we’re presenting this data in a more friendly way on caniwebview
        * Ben: we want to get as much data as possible, so please contribute
            * Working to get WebView in BCD
            * Android WebView and WkWebView
        * [https://caniwebview.com/](https://caniwebview.com/) 
            * Became the front end to exposing the data
            * Split in behaviour and web platform sections
        * Q&A:
            * Florian: provide some details on getting WebView in BCD
                * Maintain a project that is basically a test suite of web platform features and allows to run against webviews
                * Generating the difference to the upstream browsers based on BCD data
                * Would be interesting to get insights from other WebViews like the one from Meta to compare them between each other and their upstream projects
            * Ben: wanted to flag that the behavioral side is very important – want to reach a stage where the expectation between different providers is clear
                * Goal is not just to document this but work together to bring some conformance 
            * Niklas: care as a web developer that if I build a website it is supported in WebView so having a comparison site will be very useful
    * Review constraints for adding WebView to baseline
        * Ben: making sure we have a good data source that people care about when they think about WebView is important here
            * Clarifying that WebView is something the developers need – the survey can help understand how much of the community cares about 
            * Florian: baseline definition has 7 browsers (main desktop and mobile), it’s a proxy definition based on browser market share to determine if it reaches most population of not
            * François: with WebViews you have APIs that are not implemented as they should not be implemented
            * Ben: try to get a sense of how much of the population uses WebView
            * Andrew: interesting questions, we want to have service workers across WebViews and other features for the web compat story
        * Niklas: what would be next steps to get this moving
            * François: get data into BCD is first step and then get into details of the proposal to what getting WebView in the baseline means and discuss with the WebDX group
            * Niklas: we are on track to getting the data
            * Florian: the collector we used to get WkWebView, but it is not perfect
            * Ben: we can also be more proactive on our side to get a sense of how many WebViews we want there, run the collector locally and see how that will impact the baseline
            * Florian: breakout session tomorrow on curating documentation 
                * Baseline is mapping bcd keys to look at the features more broadly
                * Would be great to look at the baseline definition shift
                * If a feature is not shipped by WebViews then it is not part of baseline
                * Andrew: getting alignment on what needs to be in baseline would be important
            * François: There is an interesting question around the transition of features that were considered baseline
            * François: Happy to leave the market share discussion to you - very challenging
        * Mihai:
            * Note on what Andrew said - we could get a sense from the survey what developers care about, is it really baseline if WebViews aren’t covered?
            * Andrew: A lot of browsers are WebView based - so this is already at play in that market
