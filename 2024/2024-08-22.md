## Notes

* Welcome & Introduction
  * Admin, who is the scribe?
* FYI [W3C Groups Community Survey](https://www.w3.org/news/2024/w3c-opens-community-wide-survey/) (Estimated 6 minutes)
* Review [TPAC agenda](https://github.com/orgs/WebView-CG/discussions/5#discussioncomment-10336140)
  * Ben:
    * Baseline a big project and would be great to get WebView in there – idea is to simplify caniwebview and help developers validate if their web app will work – two pieces to it:
      * Having enough data
      * Developer awareness
    * State of WebViews report to set expectations for web developers
  * Dominique: awareness building of applying web tech on different platforms – similar discussion to [Winter CG](https://wintercg.org/), we should invite them to our meeting - AI: On Ben
    * Is the WebView survey as part of baseline?
      * Ben: the survey can be a great way to get dev perception on WebView in baseline
      * Dominique: Would be great to put a link to baseline in the agenda - AI: on Ben to chase this
    * Dominique: WebDX group is helping with other “State of [HTML|...]” reports and it might be worth linking the state of webviews with any of those
      * Ben: we can add to the agenda as point 1: intended audience
  * Ben: we thought of this structure of a good way to break the 2 days at TPAC, if you have thoughts please add to [https://github.com/orgs/WebView-CG/discussions/5](https://github.com/orgs/WebView-CG/discussions/5)
* [TPAC Breakout Session Proposals](https://github.com/w3c/tpac2024-breakouts/issues)
  * Niklas: there is still a possibility to propose breakout sessions, maybe we can create a breakout to get WebDX and WinterCG in one place as it sounds like they are working on similar things, but not sure what to put on agenda and how to call the session, so open for ideas here
    * Dominique: Web Media API CG might be relevant too, suggestion to get in touch with the WinterCG chairs and check if they will have folks around and if they are interested in collaborating on a session. Not sure what we can achieve in 1h but it could be an internal focus between the CGs to expand the scope of what folks are working on
      * First step is to have a conversation with WinterCG and see what opportunities are here
      * Niklas: good to know that we are not the only ones working on similar projects
      * Dominique: please include Dominique and Francois in conversations
      * AI on Niklas to follow up with WinterCG
* Discuss survey & baseline
  * Martin: thank you for W3C China for help with the survey and outreach
    * Survey: [https://www.wjx.cn/vm/tIIwHcA.aspx](https://www.wjx.cn/vm/tIIwHcA.aspx)
    * Will be open for a month and will end one week before TPAC (~Sep 16) – don’t know for now on the status of the responses, so far just a few in but will be open for at least 3 more weeks
    * Will share the insights with the CG once ready
    * 16 questions, made all of them optional to make it quicker to fill in, trying to simplify as much as possible
  * Ben: keen to discuss this together and decide next steps. Very excited to learn from the Android WebView perspective how things work in a space without established app store
* Caniwebview
  * Ben: pulling 2 data sources:
    * Behavioral: e.g. localhost with platform specific information
    * Web Platform: to differentiate everything that it’s in BCD
  * Ben: 2 cool things to call out:
    * Platform support: WKWebView
      * Niklas: discussion with OpenDocs folks and are interested to add WKWebview and started using their tools to collect information and made minor tweaks to their scripts to pull in the data
      * Once we think the data is in a good state we will get it merged and then we can have WKWebView in BCD
      * [https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/23747](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/23747)
      * Ben: once we start getting data from other platforms we can revisit the decision to display more insights as for now it will be too Android WebView skewed
        * we want to reach out again to Microsoft WebView team as they were keen
        * Have an email thread with caniuse lead who are interested to link to caniwebview
    * General behavioral data: all tracked under Compatibility-Data-Project: [https://github.com/WebView-CG/Compatibility-Data-Project/tree/main/_features](https://github.com/WebView-CG/Compatibility-Data-Project/tree/main/_features)
      * Would be great to work towards structuring this data more
      * Dominique: have we made comparisons with what we have in the document and use cases/challenges?
        * Ben: will take an AI here and look into it
        * Everyone should feel free to create an md file under the repo with behavior data
      * Niklas: found out from the survey that there are multiple WebView implementations there, how about we add those to caniwebview as well? Something to keep in mind and track
        * Large user base
        * Dominique: diversity of WebViews is a very interesting information, ability to collect data from them would help make the decision to include them
        * Martin: HarmonyOS and Alibaba webviews are two we might be able to get information from
        * Niklas: even adding them by name for awareness of their existence can be useful for devs
        * Abhijeet: there might also be downstream implementations of web views, and capturing those use cases could be useful.
        * Dominique: in-app browser use case and dedicated web content – opportunity to optimize the view of data in caniwebview based on the use cases
      * Ben: important things to capture, behavioral section is key
        * Niklas: once we have all the behaviors captured we can work to find the commonalities, pick the best things and work towards standardization
        * Dom: Maybe we should be clearer in our documentation that our current documentation efforts are a step towards standardization in addition to helping developers work with WebViews today.
        * Ben: this is something that we can also flag in the TPAC agenda to discuss further
* Anything else to flag/discuss?
